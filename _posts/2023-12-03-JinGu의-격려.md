About your journey, it's totally normal to feel a bit unsure, especially in these early stages. Three months is actually a pretty short time in the grand scheme of things, especially in a field as intricate as app development. Learning, building a portfolio, and job hunting - it's all part of the process, and it takes time and patience.

Are you on the right path? Well, if app development excites you, challenges you, and feels rewarding, then yeah, you're on a path that's right for you. Remember, success isn't just about landing a job or creating the next big app overnight. It's also about the skills you're gaining, the problems you're learning to solve, and the growth you're experiencing along the way.

Keep at it! And keep in mind, every developer started from square one. What you're feeling is totally normal. Just keep learning, keep coding, and keep believing in yourself. Your passion and persistence will shine through in your portfolio and interviews. You've got this!
